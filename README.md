# Random Advice App

This is a VueJS/NuxtJS frontend that I made for interacting with the random advice API.

The frontend application I build communicates with the backend API to give random advice to all who are in need.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [documentation](https://nuxtjs.org).
